    Generates a weighted grid graph of size n x m.

    Parameters:
    n (int): Number of rows in the grid.
    m (int): Number of columns in the grid.

    Graph: An instance of a grid-graph representing the weighted grid.

    Description:
    The function constructs a grid graph. NOTE: vertexs have neighbours to
    the south and east - 2 max. And only have a 1 predecessor point to it -
    this predecessor is either located to the north or west
