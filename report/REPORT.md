# Dijkstra Project

# Project Setup and Running Experiments

Each question from the assignment can be run with seperate py files.

The py files are named according to the specfic task they address
Note - ensure you have a python version > 3.xxx
Note - if you want to run the pytest - ensure it is installed.

The following is recommended:

```bash

python3 run_question1.py
python3 run_question1.py
# Pipe it to your file name of choice
python3 run_question3.py > results.txt
```

## Part 1

Description of my implementation of Dijkstra's algo using adjacency list.

Description of my Adaptable PQ - unsorted list

How to run the test graph_reader.py

## Part 2 - Generating Random Graphs

Describe my grid-graph implementation.
Describe how to run it for a small size to prove dijkstra works

## Part 3 - Evaluate Dijkstra for growing Graph sizes for 2 fixed nodes

Describe how to run the test.

Record the results - pipe to output file.

Comment on results - hint - there may be something to be said related to my APQ implementation

## Part 4 - Evaluate Dijstra for fixed Graph size but all notes shortest paths

Describe how to run the test.

A hybrid of Part3 - now I need to fix the size to 500, us the center node (250,250) as source and find all paths to all other nodes

## Part 5 - Evaluate Binary Heap APQ

Describe how to run the test.

Repeat Part 3 for Binary Heap and compare results with part 3

## Part 6 Evaluate Simple Priority Queue

Describe how to run the test.

Repeat part 4 with this PQ implementation and present results.
